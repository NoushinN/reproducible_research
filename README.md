# Introduction to reproducible research

A repository to house materials for a workshop introducing participants to reproducible research principles.

This workshop is created for the Experimentation Works (EW) working group's second cohort, a Government-of-Canada [initiative](https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/experimentation-works-ew/) to build public servants’ capacity in experimentation skills and practice through a learning-by-doing model that supports and showcases small-scale experiments in the open. 

The goal of  workshop is to teach _new-to-programming_  EW2 professionals reproducible research using the program R. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop content will follow best practices for using R, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of reproducible research.
