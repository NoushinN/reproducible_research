# Introduction to reproducible workflows

A repository to house materials for a workshop introducing participants to reproducible research principles.

This workshop is created for the [Experimentation Works (EW)](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/modernizing/experimentation-works.html) working group's second cohort, a Government-of-Canada [initiative](https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/experimentation-works-ew/) to build public servants’ capacity in experimentation skills and practice through a learning-by-doing model that supports and showcases small-scale experiments in the open. Additional information about this initiative can be found [here](https://medium.com/@exp_works/experimentation-works-2-2081cb7f49ab).

The goal of  workshop is to teach _new-to-programming_  EW2 professionals reproducible workflows using the program R. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop content will follow best practices for using R, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of reproducible workflows.
