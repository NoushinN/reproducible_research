# Introduction to open and reproducible workflows in the public service

A repository to house materials for a workshop introducing participants to open and reproducible principles.

This workshop is created for the [Experimentation Works (EW)](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/modernizing/experimentation-works.html) working group's second cohort, a Government-of-Canada [initiative](https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/experimentation-works-ew/) to build public servants’ capacity in experimentation skills and practice that supports and showcases small-scale experiments in the open. Additional information about this initiative can be found [here](https://medium.com/@exp_works/experimentation-works-2-2081cb7f49ab).

The goal of this workshop is to teach EW2 professionals open and reproducible workflows by introducing tools like R or Github. Open source tools are commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop contents will introduce tools and best practices, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of reproducible workflows.

### We will be using slido for this workshop open this [link](https://app.sli.do/event/cco9xulx/live/polls) or use participant code #45527 on sli.do

## Holy Grail <!-- Noushin and Monica -->
 - Reproducible projects 
    * What is a reproducible project? 
     * Auditable, Accurate, Collaborative 
     * Has programming language, code editor, version control software
    * Example reporducible project with beavers!

*FINAL QUIZ!*
