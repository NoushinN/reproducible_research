A repository to house materials for a open and reproducible workflows in the public service workshop.

The goal of this workshop is to introduce participants to concepts of \texttt{reproducible\ research}.
Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.

This workshop focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. As part of this, we introduce tools that enable publishing data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.

Additionally, as part of this workshop, we briefly introduce working with \texttt{R} and Rstudio to create a Rmarkdown document. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks.

\chapter{Introduction to reproducible research}\label{introduction-to-reproducible-research}}

The terms \texttt{reproducible\ research} was coined by Jon Claerbout in the 1980s when he writes an essay on \href{http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/jon/reproducible.html}{reproducible} computational research, and describes the hurdles he faces when making a text book that incorporates text, data, and results in a stand-alone document. According to Claerbout's principle, `scholarship does not only consist of theorems and proofs but also and perhaps even more important of data, computer code and a runtime environment which provides readers with the possibility to reproduce all tables and figures in an article'.

This image by The Turing Way is a great representation of what Jon Claerbout may have had in mind:

\includegraphics{rr-presentation-figure/ReproducibleJourney.jpg}

The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex and involve larger datasets, analysts, and more sophisticated computations.

\hypertarget{what-is-reproducible-research}{%
\section{what is reproducible research?}\label{what-is-reproducible-research}}

According to a U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) subcommittee on replicability in science, ``reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. This entails that a result obtained by an experiment or observational study should be achieved again with a high degree of agreement when the study is replicated with the same methodology by different researchers

\hypertarget{terminology-distinctions}{%
\subsection{Terminology distinctions}\label{terminology-distinctions}}

Reproducible research is sometimes known as reproducibility, reproducible statistical analysis, reproducible data analysis, reproducible reporting, and literate programming.

\hypertarget{reproducible-versus-replicable}{%
\subsection{Reproducible versus replicable}\label{reproducible-versus-replicable}}

Replicability means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.

\hypertarget{reproducible-versus-repeatable}{%
\subsection{Reproducible versus repeatable}\label{reproducible-versus-repeatable}}

Repeatability measures the variation in measurements taken by a single instrument or person under the same conditions, while reproducibility measures whether an entire study or experiment can be reproduced in its entirety.

This is a way for researchers to verify that their own results are true and are not just chance artifacts.

\hypertarget{reproducibility-crisis}{%
\subsection{Reproducibility crisis}\label{reproducibility-crisis}}

The replication crisis (or replicability crisis or reproducibility crisis) is, as of 2020, an ongoing methodological crisis in which it has been found that many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate or reproduce. The replication crisis affects the social sciences and medicine most severely.

\hypertarget{what-needs-to-be-reproduced}{%
\subsection{What needs to be reproduced?}\label{what-needs-to-be-reproduced}}

For evidence-informed decision making, results need to be reproducible.

The results include:
- Stattistical and inferential tables
- Visualizations/figures/graphs
- Values reported in the text
- The statistical evidence in support of the findings (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals, credible intervals).

\hypertarget{motivation}{%
\subsection{Motivation}\label{motivation}}

Some aspects to consider that may make your experiments, processes, and reports more reproducible:
1. Don't Read Between the Lines. \ldots{}\\
2. Be Strict. \ldots{}\\
3. Keep Things Transparent. \ldots{}\\
4. Collaborate. \ldots{}\\
5. Automate Your Processes.

\hypertarget{benefits-of-reproducubility}{%
\section{Benefits of reproducubility}\label{benefits-of-reproducubility}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Increased likelihood that the research will be correct
\item
  Reproducibility makes it easier to check the research
\item
  It is easier to reproduce the research independently
\item
  Easier to extend the research
\item
  Reusable code and instruction resulting in increased efficiencies
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-to-make-research-reproducible}{%
\section{How to make research reproducible}\label{how-to-make-research-reproducible}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  The first reason to repeat experiments is simply to verify results. Different science disciplines have different criteria for determining what good results are.
\item
  The next reason to repeat experiments is to develop skills necessary to extend established methods and develop new experiments. For these, we need reproducible methods, tools, and platforms.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{requirements-for-reproducibility}{%
\section{Requirements for reproducibility}\label{requirements-for-reproducibility}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  The ``raw'' data is made available, where ``raw'' refers to the data prior to any manipulation by the researcher (e.g., prior to any data cleaning and transformation).
\item
  A complete set of instructions is provided explaining all steps used in the processing and analyzing the data.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{additional-requirements}{%
\subsection{Additional requirements}\label{additional-requirements}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  A set of files is provided containing the data and code, and it is possible to create the tables and any data-derived charts/graphics/visualizations by running the code.
\item
  Details about the system being used to run the analysis: operating system, patches, random number seeds, specific versions of all software/packages/libraries are listed.
\item
  The code is written in a way that can be readily understood.
\item
  Open/transparent. All the data and materials are available (as opposed to ``available upon request'') -- e.g., posted on GitHub, or in an international data repository.
\item
  That is, either:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Another party (e.g., a reviewer) has successfully reproduced the results and certified them as such.\\
\item
  Logs demonstrate that key results were successfully created from the inputs.\\
\item
  The key results are linked to the data and code, so the relationship can be directly inspected.
\end{itemize}

A final requirement, which is sometimes known as literate programming, is that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  The entire report is written using code. That is, a file or files are provided which, when run, import the data, produce all the results, insert the results into the text of the report, and format the report.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{tools-for-reproducible-projects}{%
\chapter{Tools for reproducible projects}\label{tools-for-reproducible-projects}}

``An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself,
it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.''
--- Jonathan Buckheit and David Donoho, paraphrasing Jon Claerbout

``In 2002, I felt like I would just remember everything forever,'' Karl Broman, a biostatistician at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ``It was only later that it became clear that you start to forget things within a month.''

\hypertarget{barriers}{%
\subsection{Barriers}\label{barriers}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Human subject data or proprietary code aren't shared and we need to implement creative solutions
\item
  Journals and funders don't reward reproducibility
\item
  Analysts need to be taught reproducible methodology and there is a steep learning curve
\item
  Need to make these efforts common place
\item
  Software changes, new versions are released and older code breaks.
\item
  Files are removed or moved and all the code breaks.
\item
  One file is updated but the rest of the code/files are not updated.
\item
  One forgets which files depend on which other files, or what has been changed
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tools}{%
\section{Tools}\label{tools}}

``Your primary collaborator is yourself 6 months from now, and your past self doesn't answer emails.'' - software carpentry

In this section, the tools that make reproducibility and open workflows easier are divided into four categories and these are not exhaustive. The categories include tools for data, methods, results, and communication products.

\includegraphics{rr-presentation-figure/tools.png}

The basics of research (data) management can be applied to every research project. These concepts include:
i) storing data carefully and securely (according to the appropriate standards in the case of sensitive data)\\
ii) backing up frequently and in at least two separate locations\\
iii) using a file naming convention so that others within and outside a project can understand a file's content.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

The question we can ask ourselves is how can we make the data FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Findable: e.g.~Make data available in trusted data repository\\
\item
  Accessible (store in open non-proprietary platforms/formats): e.g.~include comprehensive metadata
\item
  Interoperable (standardized and has identifiers): e.g.~store in open (non-proprietary) formats
\item
  Reusable (open with comprehensive metadata): For open data, attach a licence or rights waiver, or a permanent identifier (i.e.~DOI)
\end{itemize}

Some tools include:\\
- Shared drive/Local Area Network (LAN)/Sharepoint\\
\includegraphics{rr-presentation-figure/LAN.png}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Google sheets / OpenRefine\\
\item
  Open government portal\\
\item
  GitHub\\
  \includegraphics{rr-presentation-figure/Covid.png}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

How can we make the process by which we do our work more open and reproducible? How could others access this work?

Some tools include:\\
- GCconnex\\
- Protocols.io

\includegraphics{rr-presentation-figure/methods.png}
- GitHub

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

How can we adequately share the results with team members and tweak the methods to answer new questions/test new hypotheses?

Some tool examples include:\\
- Shared drive/LAN/Sharepoint and connection with respective analytic/data science softwares\\
- Google docs and other microsoft suites\\
\includegraphics{rr-presentation-figure/results1.png}
- Github\\
\includegraphics{rr-presentation-figure/results2.png}

\hypertarget{communication-products}{%
\subsection{Communication products}\label{communication-products}}

Once our work is done - how can we make it most accessible?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cochrane reports\\
\item
  Open access publications\\
\item
  Public talks\\
\item
  Media/Social Media\\
\item
  Github
\end{itemize}

Other considerations:\\
1. Share data, software, workflows, methods and results in open trusted repositories
2. Persistent links, permanent identifiers for data, code, digital artifacts upon which the results depend
3. Enable credit for shared digital scholarly objects with citations
4. Adequately document to facilitate reuse
5. Use Open Licensing
6. Journals should conduct a reproducibility check
7. Funding agencies should instigate new research programs and pilot studies

\hypertarget{giving-and-receiving-credits}{%
\chapter{Giving and receiving credits}\label{giving-and-receiving-credits}}

How do we make sure that others credit our work and we credit others?

We've often heard of Copyright, the authors' and composers' rights represented by the symbol ©.
It means All rights reserved therefore, we can't do anything with work that's copyright protected, unless we get permission directly from the author or composer, his or her representative (editor) or collective societies entrusted by authors and composers to manage their rights.

On the other hand, there exists the Copyleft, giving permission to anyone to copy, broadcast, use, modify and distribute work as long as some rights are reserved fairly. The author who chooses Copyleft lets other creators of the world know that they can do what they want with his or her work (within the limits of morality).

Although Copyright and Copyleft are on opposite sides of the spectrum, there are additional parameters we can use. For instance, Creative Commons, provides the spectrum and helps us legally share our knowledge and creativity to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world --- unlocking the full potential of the internet to drive a new era of development, growth and productivity.

\includegraphics{rr-presentation-figure/rightleft.png}

Creative Commons lets you create licenses by choosing one or more permissions based on parameters like copying your work, modifying (remixing) it, sharing it, broadcasting it, distributing it, reusing it, and its attribution (giving due credit to its author). Different combinations are available.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open source code licences (MIT/Open Canada)
\item
  Information licences (Creative Commons)

  \texttt{origin} : connection pointing to the remote repository
\item
  \texttt{master} : name of your default branch. A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to a commit
\item
  \texttt{working\ directory} : local repository
\item
  \texttt{.git\ directory} : Git stores all of its repository data in the .git directory. This is created when a local repository is initialised using the \texttt{init} command
\item
  \texttt{.git.ignore} : Git uses this file to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit
\item
  \texttt{hash}: the commit command creates a unique ID called a hash, which is an absolute path
\item
  \texttt{HEAD} : pointer to the last commit of the branch you are currently on. If you are on the master branch, then HEAD and master will refer to the same commit. This is a relative path. To see the previous commit use \texttt{HEAD\textasciitilde{}1}
