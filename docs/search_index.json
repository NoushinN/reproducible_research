The goal of this workshop is to teach concepts of reproducible research to new-to-programming professionals. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This workshop focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. As part of this, we introduce tools that enable publishing data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results. Additionally, as part of this workshop, we briefly introduce data structures, importing and wrangling data, exploring missingness, as well as data visualizations and reporting. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop content will follow best practices for using R, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of R and scientific computing.
