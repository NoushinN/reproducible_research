The goal of this workshop is to teach concepts of reproducible research to new-to-programming professionals. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This workshop focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. As part of this, we introduce tools that enable publishing data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results. Additionally, as part of this workshop, we briefly introduce data structures, importing and wrangling data, exploring missingness, as well as data visualizations and reporting. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop content will follow best practices for using R, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of R and scientific computing.

According to a U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) subcommittee on replicability in science, “reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. 2.2 Terminology distinctions Reproducible research is sometimes known as reproducibility, reproducible statistical analysis, reproducible data analysis, reproducible reporting, and literate programming. 2.3 Reproducible versus replicable Replicability means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data. 2.4 Reproducible versus repeatable Repeatability measures the variation in measurements taken by a single instrument or person under the same conditions, while reproducibility measures whether an entire study or experiment can be reproduced in its entirety. This is a way for researchers to verify that their own results are true and are not just chance artifacts. 2.5 Reproducibility crisis The replication crisis (or replicability crisis or reproducibility crisis) is, as of 2020, an ongoing methodological crisis in which it has been found that many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate or reproduce. The replication crisis affects the social sciences and medicine most severely. 2.6 What needs to be reproduced? Actual results themselves, which includes: - Tables - Visualizations/figures/graphs - Values reported in the text - The statistical evidence in support of the findings (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals, credible intervals). 2.7 Motivation Attempt to make experiments, processes, and reports more reproducible. Some aspects to consider that may make your experiments more reproducible: 1. Don’t Read Between the Lines. … 2. Be Strict. … 3. Keep Things Transparent. … 4. Collaborate. … 5. Automate Your Processes. 2.8 Benefits of reproducubility Increased likelihood that the research will be correct Reproducibility makes it easier to check the research It is easier to reproduce the research independently Easier to extend the research Reusable code and instruction resulting in increased efficiencies 2.9 How to make research reproducible The first reason to repeat experiments is simply to verify results. Different science disciplines have different criteria for determining what good results are. The next reason to repeat experiments is to develop skills necessary to extend established methods and develop new experiments. For these, we need reproducible methods, tools, and platforms. 2.10 Requirements for reproducibility The “raw” data is made available, where “raw” refers to the data prior to any manipulation by the researcher (e.g., prior to any data cleaning and transformation). A complete set of instructions is provided explaining all steps used in the processing and analyzing the data. 2.11 Additional requirements A set of files is provided containing the data and code, and it is possible to create the tables and any data-derived charts/graphics/visualizations by running the code. Details about the system being used to run the analysis: operating system, patches, random number seeds, specific versions of all software/packages/libraries are listed. The code is written in a way that can be readily understood. Open/transparent. All the data and materials are available (as opposed to “available upon request”) – e.g., posted on GitHub, or in an international data repository. That is, either: – Another party (e.g., a reviewer) has successfully reproduced the results and certified them as such. – Logs demonstrate that key results were successfully created from the inputs. – The key results are linked to the data and code, so the relationship can be directly inspected. A final requirement, which is sometimes known as literate programming, is that: The entire report is written using code. That is, a file or files are provided which, when run, import the data, produce all the results, insert the results into the text of the report, and format the report. "],

The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.” — Jonathan Buckheit and David Donoho, paraphrasing Jon Claerbout “In 2002, I felt like I would just remember everything forever,” Karl Broman, a biostatistician at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “It was only later that it became clear that you start to forget things within a month.” 3.1 Tools R, Rstudio, python, open-refine, good tables notebooks (Rmarkdown, Jupyter, holepunch) 3.2 Components to control operating system (and libraries) R/Python versions Package versions if all of these are controlled, the analysis will always be reproducible Tools that help: - docker: complete control of operating system - package snapshots - packrat "],

A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to a commit working directory : local repository .git directory : Git stores all of its repository data in the .git directory. This is created when a local repository is initialised using the init command .git.ignore : Git uses this file to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit hash: the commit command creates a unique ID called a hash, which is an absolute path HEAD : pointer to the last commit of the branch you are currently on. If you are on the master branch, then HEAD and master will refer to the same commit. This is a relative path. To see the previous commit use HEAD~1 6.2 GIT Commands Initialise git init &lt;local repository name&gt;initialises a new local repository Remotes git remote add &lt;remote name&gt; &lt;url&gt; creates a new connection to a remote repository is the shortcut for the and is typically set to ‘origin’ git remote show &lt;remote name&gt; shows which branch is automatically pushed to when you run git push while on certain branches. It also shows you which remote branches on the server you don’t yet have, which remote branches you have that have been removed from the server, and multiple local branches that are able to merge automatically with their remote-tracking branch when you run git pull git remote rename &lt;remote name&gt; &lt;new remote name&gt; rename a remote git remote remove &lt;remote name&gt; remove a remote git remote -v lists the remotes that are configured Branches git branch &lt;new branch name&gt; adds a new branch, a structure with trees for saved states of files git checkout &lt;branch name&gt; &lt;filename&gt; checks out (i.e. switches to another version) an old version of a file git branch lists all of the branches in a repository, with a * next to the branch you are currently on git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt; switches to another branch-name git checkout -b branch-name&gt; creates the branch and switches you to it git merge source destination merges two branches Status git status shows which files have changed/new in your repository git diff shows the changes you made to the file git diff --staged shows the difference between the last committed change and what’s in the staging area git diff directory shows the changes to the files in the directory git diff -r HEAD -r flag refers to compare to a particular revision git log view the log of the project’s history git show &lt;hash&gt; view the details of a specific commit, with the first few characters of the commit’s hash git annotate &lt;filename&gt; shows who made the last change to each line of a file and when Clone git clone &lt;remote name&gt; to clone a repo and download a copy of a repo to a local folder This automatically creates the remote called origin Add git add adds from your working directory to your staging area, ie specifies what will go in a snapshot git add &lt;filename&gt; stages a file git add -A stages all new, modified and deleted git add &lt;foldername&gt;/* adds folder and contents to your staging area Remove git clean -n shows a list of files that are in the repository, but whose history Git is not currently tracking git clean -f will then delete those files Undo git reset undo ALL changes that have been staged with git add git reset HEAD &lt;filename&gt; undo changes to a specific filename that have been staged on HEAD Commit git commit -m &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot; commits the file with the snapshot to the local repository locally. The commit records the changes to the file ie actually takes the snapshot and makes a permanent record of it Fetch git fetch gets any new work since last clone or fetch. Fetch does not however merge remote work with our work Pull git pull automatically fetches and then merges that remote branch into your current branch Push git push adds the files to your remote git Note on adding files to the remote: When it is your first push from a repo, you will first have to make the link between the local and remote repository via: git push --set-upstream origin master, or shorter git push -u origin master. As of then, git push will refer to the upstream branch you’ve set: i.e. origin / master 6.3 Resources Happy Git and GitHub for the useR by Jennifer Bryan adapted under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.
